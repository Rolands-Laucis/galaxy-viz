# This is a repo for a visualization renderer for the song "Rolands Laucis - Projects (can't do it all)"

Made with Svelte, P5.js (minified included in repo, because p5 is a pain in the ass to import as an ES6 module) and love for design :)

## Get started

Download repo, install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Terminal should tell you that its live on localhost:5000 and should also be available on other devices on a local network.
